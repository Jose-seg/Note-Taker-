# Note-Taker-

## Description
This app is a simple note taker, the assignment was to refactor given code to us and create a server.js file to be able to enable all our neccessary routes. The backend of the code helps deal with the routes of the paths we want to redirect the user to as well as deleting and posting information such as any notes the user inputs.

## Usage 
The purpose of the app is to provide the user with a simple note taker, it utilizes front end, which was given to me since this assignment is a refactor, and as well as back end that I coded in order to direct the user to the specific route paths that make the app functional. The user will use this app to take notes as reminders, this assignment helped me understand routes and how to traverse through them.
